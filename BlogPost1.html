        <h2>A Tale of Two Tricksters</h2>
    </a>
    <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my mythology class. </h5>
              <p>
                Bill Cipher is the antagonist of the Disney Channel show, Gravity Falls (Hirsch, Alex. 2012 – 2016). While seemingly harmless and even friendly on first glance, this character deceives people for his own benefit, disrespects law and order, has hurt others, and all for the ultimate goal of opening a portal to another dimension.</p> <p> Stan Pines, however, is one of the show’s protagonists. While seemingly harmless and even friendly on first glance, this character deceives people for his own benefit, disrespects law and order, has hurt others, and all for the ultimate goal of opening a portal to another dimension. It would be easy to say that this is a contradiction, that said characters cannot be both heroes and villains with their striking similarities. But to do so would be to look past the series’ goal, it’s ultimate message that deceit is a tool, and like all tools, is neutral.</p> 
                <p> The morality of deceit is entirely on who is, and why it is being used.
                Before continuing, it would be wise to say in plain terms that Bill Cipher and Stan Pines are both trickster archetypes, and to then lay out what it means, and does not mean to be of that archetype. Described by William Hynes in his book “Mythical Trickster Figures” are several characteristics common among tricksters. Most expectedly, is the deceiver or trick player trait. Bill shows this quite often, one scene that sticks out is when the strange God-like being appears to the character of Dipper, the protagonist.</p> <p> Dipper is desperate to open a laptop that contains critical information, that is when Bill makes his deal. Dipper will give him a puppet, and Bill will open the laptop. Dipper agrees, only to realize that Bill has kicked his spirit out of his own body, which he then uses his full control of to destroy the laptop. This also shows Bill as a malicious spoiler kind of trickster, that is, a character who does things specifically to hurt others. </p> 
                <p>
                In one scene, Stan is trying to hurt tourist traps that are in competition to his own. He distracts the owner of the world’s biggest ball of yarn to unravel it by tying it to his car and driving off. At the end of the episodes, the woman, as well as several others tourist trap owners appear to deface his own establishment. This is an example of the tricksters’ trick back firing, another common trait amongst tricksters. </p> 
                <p>
                With that said, marking out a rigid set of rules to designate a trickster is a fool's errand. Indeed, even someone such as William Hynes has pointed out that no two are completely alike. But there is one trait that is at the heart of every trickster, and certainly the biggest point of comparison between Bill and Stan. Hunger. “In the invention of traps, trickster is a technician of appetite and a technician of instinct.” (Hyde, 1999) In other words, the trickster is hungry. Hungry for wealth, fame, and fun. Just as much as they want, they know just as well how to get. They can recognize other’s hunger, and they will utilize that knowledge to get what they want. No better do these guidelines describe a character like Loki, than characters like Bill and Stan. </p> 
                <p>
                They have an appetite, and they will exploit other’s appetite to satiate their own. For Stan Pines, a conman running The Mystery Shack, a tourist trap in the middle of nowhere, it means wowing gullible tourists and townsfolk with cheaply made attractions like the ‘Rock That looks Like a Face’ to inflate his eager wallet. He wants money, so he will overcharge, scam, and mislead those in his shop to get it. For Bill, a mysterious God like being from another dimension, it means appearing in people’s dreams and persuading them to do his bidding, or just to indulge in the misery he can trick them into doing.</p> 
                <p>
                However, their hunger goes deeper than that. At a pivotal point in the show, it is revealed that Stan had an extremely intelligent brother who was working on a portal that would lead to other dimensions. Due to Stan’s carelessness however, his brother was sucked into the portal, trapped between other dimensions. Stan, having already been kicked out of his parents’ house, has nobody to turn to, and all the guilt in the world to keep him company. But, he has one skill that has gotten him through life, advertising. Setting up The Mystery Shack in what was his brother’s lab, Stan dedicates his life and career to learning how the portal works and getting the funds to repair and operate it. He scams and cheats to get that money and will not stop at any cost. Even when he is old enough to become a great uncle, he still keeps going.</p> 
                <p>
                On the other end of the spectrum, is Bill. He has a similar goal to Stan, finding a way into another dimension, our dimension. His goal however, isn’t to save somebody, to repent or to simply live, it’s to wreak havoc and have fun with other chaotic beings. In an essay about trickster characters, Andy Fullmer had this to say about Bill, “He disregards convention. He’s also evil — but in a fun way, while also being the catalyst for dramatic change, even if it’s apocalyptic.” (Fullmer, Andy. 2019.) It doesn't get simpler, or more complicated. He deceives because he can, and nothing will stop him from doing so, not matter how cruel or arbitrary, all because it’s fun.</p> 
                <p>
                So, it all comes back to apatite. Stan isn’t just hungry for cash, he is hungry for familial love, the safety of his family, and for his own repentance. Bill, by comparison, hungers only for his own joy. To show just how much, in a scene late in the show, Bill makes a giant throne out of the bodies of the Gravity Falls townsfolk who have all been turned to stone. With all that said, it is a good time to mention that it is not uncommon for tricksters to be so different from each other, including in terms of their morality. A good comparison between these two characters comes from “African Myths of Origin” by Stephen Belcher. In the book, Stephen retells an African trickster myth of Nanni. In one myth, Nanni would roll and dance around innocently enough, until it’s revealed he is covered in gum, so as to use its stickiness to steal beans from his neighbors. Eventually, Nanni losses his hands as a result of his deceit. Compare that to the story of Ananse, who deceived animal upon animal in order to fulfill a request by the sky God and receive a luxurious reward in turn.</p> 
                <p>
                One is punished, one is rewarded, that also describes the fate of Bill and Stan. At the end of the show, Bill, having successfully entered our dimension, seems to have won. Everyone has been defeated, the town is in ruins, Stan and his brother are caged, there seems to be no hope left. The final key to the lock is for Bill to enter the mind of Stan’s brother, to extract information on how to spread his influence. Stan’s brother agrees, Bill enters his mind... and it was a deception. The mind Bill entered wasn’t of Stan’s brother, it was of Stan himself. They had swapped clothes moments earlier. With his family in jeopardy, Stan agrees to take the final blow, and have his mind erased, along with Bill. While Bill and his threat have been defeated, Stan without memory seems to make it a pyrrhic victory. However, with a lot of hard work, and when all is said and done, Stan gets his memory back. Bill was destroyed begging for his life, Stan lived on, with his family safe, and finally with repentance from his past mistakes.</p> 
                <p>
                While the role of the trickster is often associated with bad or morally bankrupt people, Gravity Falls shows two tricksters, similar in many ways, but with vastly different goals. With it, vastly different endings. This sends a message, that to lie and deceive isn’t black and white. Where it may be used by someone like Bill to harm, it can be used by someone like Stan to save. In a book following the show’s ending, the show’s creator had this to say, “‘Trust No One.’ What an absurd and paranoid idea. Trust shouldn't be given unconditionally, but it should be given a chance to be earned. There is strength in having the humility to work with and sacrifice for others-” (Hirsch, Alex. Gravity Falls Journal 3)
