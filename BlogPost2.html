        <h2>Devil May Cry 5: Synergy of the Craft</h2>
    </a>
    <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my art appreciation class. </h5>
              <p>
                Devil May Cry 5 is a standout example of a work of art utilizing all elements of the craft at their full potential. According to interviews for Polygon and The Verge the game was developed over a course of four years for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox one. The developers consisted partially of staff who worked on 2017’s Resident Evil 7, due to their experience with the RE Engine, which would be reused for the development of DMC5. The big challenges for the team this time around, involved the new characters and a change in art direction. </p>
<p>Where the technology used for previous games was cutting edge, it was limited by what was possible for the time, which gave the graphics of even the most high budget games an unrealistic quality. To compensate, the developers leaned into a stylized aesthetic, inspired by anime. According to Devil May Cry 5 - Design Philosophy, the decision was made for DMC5 to change course, and utilize the comparatively larger power of then current hardware for a more realistic aesthetic.</p> This was seen as a risk as the team was worried their new approach would alienate Japanese fans, it also proved a challenge in that they had to give extra time to fine tune the animations in and out of gameplay to facilitate this new-found realism. Yet another difficulty this change brought was the effort put towards making sure the character designs were still just as memorable under the new art direction.
<p>This effort extended to the game’s new characters as well. The developers were particularly worried about them, because the series had amassed a loyal fanbase with several characters reaching iconic status among the industry; they wanted to ensure the new characters were just as likable and memorable as the originals. Especially V, one of the games’ protagonists, and one pf the three playable characters. Their effort seems to have paid off as,according to the team, the player response to the new characters has been completely glowing, as with the game itself. </p>
<p>4: From a gameplay perspective, this work is an over-the-top brawler with a focus on being stylish. At the heart of its story, Devil May Cry 5 is a game about the importance of family. These may seem like disconnected ideals, but the beauty of the game is in the way it unites these two concepts into a cohesive whole. This can be seen most clearly by taking a look at the game’s last level, and the events leading up to it. </p>
<p>Regarding the last level, in an interview with the game’s director on usgamer, Itsuno’s goal for that part of the game was to make the player cry. Does the game manage this? If so, how? First, some context. This game revolves around two characters, Dante, a half human, half demon hybrid and legendary demon hunter; and Nero, another demon human hybrid, and a devil hunter earlier in his career. They are both hired by V, a mysterious man who tasks the both of them to destroy an extremely powerful demon named Urizan who has resurrected.</p> The mission holds special importance for Nero for two reasons, because one, the demon cut off his left arm in a previous clash, filling him with a desire for revenge. Two, In the previous game, Nero failed to protect his foster brother due to in his opinion, a lack of strength. The inciting incident takes place with the three men completely failing at taking down Urizen, Nero once again lacking the strength needed succeed. The rest of the game is spent gaining power by taking down weaker demons in the name of preparing for the final fight against Urizen.
<p>The gameplay is where the characters show their true colors. Where Nero is hotheaded and arrogant, Dante is Coolheaded and cocky. Rarely do they take their foes seriously, the player even has a button dedicated to taunting demons. The gameplay itself can be seen as an extension of the characters and their personalities. When Nero attacks, he’s fierce and wildly tears through his enemies with a flaming sword and revolver using all his strength. Dante, on the other hand, is much more controlled and elegant, but still cocky.</p> He uses a range of weapons that can include a demonic motorcycle that can transform into a chainsaw, and a cowboy hat that can possess enemies.
<p>This all once again begs the question, how does a game like this tie into family, let alone even attempt to make the player cry? The answer is in an earlier statement, that the gameplay is an extension of the characters. At all times, their goals in the story line up with the goals of the player from a gameplay perspective; gain power, defeat enemies. If the characters don’t take the enemies seriously, the player probably won’t either. If they do, then the player probably will as well, for the player intrinsically has empathy for the characters they control.</p> Much like how an actor will feel the emotions of a character they act as, a player will feel the emotions of the character they role-play as, if the game can foster the player character relationship.
<p>Devil May Cry 5 is well aware of this relationship, and uses it to its advantage, when the characters fail to defeat Urizen, the player does not sit back and watch it happen, the sequence happens during gameplay. The player is instructed to defeat Urizen on the very first level, but the player will be inexperienced, and lacking in powers gained throughout the game, and will most certainly lose the fight. When this happens, the player feels how the characters feel, that they lost because they didn’t have enough power or experience. </p>
<p>While much of the game has the characters defeating enemies with style and, again, with motorcycles and cowboy hats, as the game reaches its climax, it will raise the stakes to the point the characters will have no choice but to take the threats completely seriously, and as such, the player will too. There will be spoilers from here on. Late in the game, two things are revealed. One, is that V and Urizen are actually two halves of the same person.</p> Dante’s brother, Vergil, wanting to finally defeat Dante and settle a lone standing rivalry, he split his soul in two so that his humanity wouldn’t bring down the strength his demon side brings. Eventually, V, his human side, and Urizen, his demon side, come together and Vergil is whole once again. The second reveal, is that Vergil is Nero’s father. 
<p>Late in the game, there’s a scene where Dante, telling all this to Nero, ditches his cocky nature in a moment of complete seriousness. Nero, is void of his hotheaded attitude. Dante puts it on himself to defeat Vergil once and for all, while Nero is left aimless. It is then, that the last level begins. Nero gets on the phone with his girlfriend, he remembers how he couldn’t protect his foster brother before, how he lacked strength for so long, and now, his only family are going to fight each other to the death.</p> He makes a decision. He runs as fast as he ever has to where Dante and Vergil are dueling. They’re about to strike each other down. Suddenly, Nero transforms, his is full power is unleashed. The soundtrack swells, and Nero he gets in-between them right before they can kill each other.
<p>The final boss begins. Nero, with his newfound power, fights Vergil, not to kill him, but smack some since into him and get them both to stop. For the final time, the player’s gameplay goals, line up with the character’s motivations. The player is given brand new tools in the form of Nero’s full power. While the gameplay goal is the same as its been for the whole game, defeat enemies to win, the newfound context allows the player to act out the game’s most emotional moment, Nero fighting to protect the only family he’s ever known from each other.</p>
<p>In the mini documentary video Discussions with Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil 2 Remake Directors - toco toco, DMC5’s director is talking about the first game in the series, which he didn’t direct, but did play, “What surprised me the most about the first [devil may cry] game, was that it felt like any story could fit within that genre.” That is at the heart of what makes the DMC5 special, it takes gameplay that is usually geared towards making the player feel cool, and manages to perfectly fit a compelling story of family within it, without losing anything in the process.</p>
