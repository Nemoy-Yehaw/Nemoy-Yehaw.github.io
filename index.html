     <h2>  A Tale of Two Tricksters</h2>
      </a>
      <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my mythology class.</h5>
          <p>Bill Cipher is the antagonist of the Disney Channel show, Gravity Falls (Hirsch, Alex. 2012 – 2016). While seemingly harmless and even friendly on first glance, this character deceives people for his own benefit, disrespects law and order, has hurt others, and all for the ultimate goal of opening a portal to another dimension...

          <h2> Devil May Cry 5: Synergy of the Craft</h2>
          </a>
          <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my art appreciation class.</h5>
           <p>
                Devil May Cry 5 is a standout example of a work of art 
                utilizing all elements of the craft at their full potential. 
                According to interviews for Polygon and The Verge the game was 
                developed over a course of four years for the PlayStation 4 and 
                Xbox one. The developers consisted partially of staff who 
                worked on 2017’s Resident Evil 7, due to their experience 
                with the RE Engine, which would be reused for the development 
                of DMC5. The big challenges for the team this time around, 
                involved the new characters and a change in art direction.

            <h2>Metal Gear Sophia</h2>
        </a>
            <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my philosophy class.</h5>
                 <p> In 1998 and 2001, the first two games in the Metal Gear Solid series were released. They’re action games that focus on stealth, and generally star action movie-esque heroes outmaneuvering and defeating terrorists. Except, this series is about much more than just action and bombast. Looking at them as a trilogy, they all ask a single repeated question, what is our purpose? What makes us, us? the heroes of these games aren't just avatars for the player, but methods of exploring these questions through their experiences in the game's stories. To get into that, let’s get into the games themselves. </P>
