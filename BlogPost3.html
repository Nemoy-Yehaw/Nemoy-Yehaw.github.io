        <h2>Metal Gear Sophia</h2>
    </a>
    <h5>The following is an essay I wrote in 2021 for my philosophy class. </h5>
  <p>
    <p>In 1998 and 2001, the first two games in the Metal Gear Solid series were released. They’re action games that focus on stealth, and generally star action movie-esque heroes outmaneuvering and defeating terrorists. Except, this series is about much more than just action and bombast. Looking at them as a trilogy, they all ask a single repeated question, what is our purpose? What makes us, us? the heroes of these games aren't just avatars for the player, but methods of exploring these questions through their experiences in the game's stories. To get into that, let’s get into the games themselves. </P>
    <p>When designing the first three installments, they were each given a tagline that describes their themes in a single word. The first two are “gene” and “meme.” Metal Gear Solid from 1998 explores “gene” or more specifically, the way our genes define us. The protagonist, Solid Snake, is introduced as an almost typical action hero taken out of retirement. He’s stoic, driven, flirtatious and all with a few one liners to boot. As the game progresses however, cracks start to form in this architype. Midway through the game, a lover interest named Maryl is introduced, and the game teases sexual tension between them.</p> However, upon defeating Psycho Mantis, a psychic soldier, the terrorist notes how of all the minds he’s read, Snake’s was the only one completely uninterested in sex. 
    <p>This moment marks a reoccurring theme, of characters acting outside the expectations the audience, and the other characters have for them. Depending on the player’s choices, Maryl can be killed at a pivotal moment in the game, later, a geeky scientist who has been assisting Snake exclaims how snake is like an action hero, only for Snake to solemnly reply that the hero always saves the girl. These moments bring attention to a conflict between who someone is “supposed” to be, and who they actually are. Society, family and even we ourselves, often put people into boxes. So often we have heard people say things like woman are “just like that” or you “can’t expect much from someone like him.” </p>Whether we want to or not, we have a role, and expectations to live up to.
    <p>For Snake, he has the role to play of a soldier, an action hero. Near the end of the game, a revelation makes this clearer than ever before. The villain, a man codenamed Liquid Snake, informs Solid Snake that they are both clones of a legendary soldier named Big Boss. They were made to emulate him for America, they were made to be the action hero. Liquid, seeing himself as having all the inferior genes compared to Snake, hatefully obsesses over him and his victories, enough to want to kill him and become the true successor to Big Boss. “All human beings live to pass on the legacy of their parents.” Liquid says to Snake.</p>
    <p>Except, Solid Snake had already failed at living up to his role, and more importantly, he isn’t going to try. He isn’t going to let his reason for being born define his reason for living. In the end, when Liquid is defeated and the sun has risen over the base, Snake doesn't ride off into the sunrise with Maryl, but Otacon, the geeky scientist. It’s not the action movie final, but it doesn't need to be, and it’s the one the game ends on. What Snake learned, is that the only one to live for, is himself, and he’ll be the one to choose who he’ll be.</p>
    <p>Come Metal Gear Solid 2, Snake and Otacon have started an organization dedicated to exposing dangerous robot weapons known as Metal Gear. Their mission isn’t one of saving the day and beating the bad guy, but of exposing the truth and protecting the world. At this point, they know who they are and what they want to be as people. While he could have easily stayed with the United States and lived as a venerated soldier, Snake has become complete by pursuing what he wants, not what he’s told to do. And really, nobody can feel complete just doing what they’re told, to accomplish something, to become someone you want to be, is the most fulfilling thing in the world.</p>
    <p>Enter, Raiden, the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid 2. Raiden knows all about Snake, he’s spent hours doing Virtual Reality training in recreations of Snakes missions. If there’s anyone cool enough, strong enough, and brave enough to save the world, it’s Snake, the greatest soldier who ever lived. And Raiden wants more than anything to emulate him. Luckily for him, his current mission is to defeat terrorists and save the world from their plot, just like what Snake did. Except where Snake didn’t pursue anyone, Raiden has a girlfriend, Rose, and she’s on his support team. Throughout the game, Raiden keeps in contact with her, and these conversations show someone far from the collected Snake that he tries to be. While the two do love each other, they bond over movies for instance, Raiden just won’t open up to her. </p>
    <p>At one point Rose says that she tried entering his room one day, and there was almost nothing in it, only a bed and table. No posters, no decoration, nothing. Who is Raiden? If you ask, he won’t say much. You ask him who wants to be, it’s Snake. Where Snake needed to find out he didn’t have to be someone else, Raiden doesn't even know who he’s supposed to be. He lacks a sense of self, he tunes everything out and focuses only on what he likes, nothing personally fulfilling or rewarding. People without identity to call their own, people who want more than anything than to be told what to do with their lives, are vulnerable to exploitation. </p>
    <p>It can be seen in cults that shower people with love and give them a purpose, only to repress and use them. Or in radical movements like the white supremacists. Not only are you special, you’re better than everyone else too! For Raiden, this exploitation comes in the form of The Patriots. At the end of the game, after fighting terrorists, discovering conspiracies and discovering the real Solid Snake is here on his own mission, Raiden calls his superior officer. And then, his superior officer, malfunctions. Because he’s not real, but an AI. He calls Rose, she confesses that she was ordered to pretend to be his girlfriend, but really did love him. Then she too, malfunctions.</p> He teams up with snake to confront the villains once and for all, and the truth is revealed. Everything that occurred in the game until that point, was set up by an all-intelligent group of AIs known as The Patriots. Raiden’s triumphs, his failures, they all happened as The Patriots intended. Rose? Might not even be real. 
    <p>He thought he knew reality, but he didn’t even know himself. Without having a strong sense of morals or beliefs or identity, he became the perfect drone to be used. All he had to do was fulfil his role. It’s at this moment, he has a conversation with Snake. For the first time he doesn't look at Snake as some ideal, but as a man. He asks Snake what he should do, and Snake says to choose for himself what to believe in and what to pass on. To choose for himself what’s reality. The Patriots have one final goal for him, to defeat the final terrorist. Raiden doesn't have much of a choice in what he does at this point, but he does have a choice on what to make of it.</p> So, he duels him, not for The Patriots, but because it’s what’s the right thing to do. When the battle is over and he sees Rose in the street, he digs deep into the feeling in his gut and decides that she is real, that their love is real, and so he makes his choice, not as a soldier or a pawn, but as Raiden. And finally, he becomes his own person. 
    <p>The difference between Snake and Raiden is that Snake needed to be told he could be whoever he wanted to be, Raiden needed to be told he could be somebody at all. Without a strong hold on who you are, you can be exploited or used by people who want to tell you who you are, or what to believe. But only we can form a purpose, only we can overcome expectations and be ourselves. What we are told and what we don’t know may influence us, but they do not define us. In this modern day when misinformation spreads so rapidly and everyone wants to be like the people they follow on social media, Metal Gear Solid says that you don’t have to be them, they might not even be the people you think they are to begin with.</p> That you have, and deserve, the freedom to be, or become who you want to be. No matter what anybody else says.
